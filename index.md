Android wrapper for logging information.

# Including in your project

ShoutOut is available in the Jcenter, so getting it as simple as adding it as a dependency

```gradle
compile 'com.github.nisrulz:shoutout:{latest version}'
```
where `{latest version}` corresponds to published version in [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/nisrulz/maven/com.github.nisrulz%3Ashoutout/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/nisrulz/maven/com.github.nisrulz%3Ashoutout/_latestVersion)

#Usage

+ First create and init shoutout

```java
    ShoutOut shoutOut;
    // Init the ShoutOut Lib
    shoutOut = ShoutOut.withTag(debuggable, TAG);

    // or you can also init as below to specify a priority
    shoutOut = ShoutOut.withTagAndPriority(debuggable,TAG, priority);
```
where `priority` can be `Log.DEBUG`, `Log.ERROR`, `Log.ASSERT`, `Log.WTF` or `Log.INFO`

+ Now log data as below

```java
    // Debug Logs
    shoutOut.log("This is Debug information here in LOGCAT");

    // Error Logs
    shoutOut.withCause(new RuntimeException("Hello! I am Runtime exception"));
```

+ You can chain an extra debug log to exception log

```java
  shoutOut.log("This is Debug information here that is chained for adding a message to exception stacktrace in LOGCAT")
          .withCause(new RuntimeException("Hello! I am Runtime exception"));

``` 


# Pull Requests

I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:

  1. Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using `CMD`+`Option`+`L` (Reformat code) on Mac (not sure for Windows) with Android Studio defaults.
  
  2. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
  
  3. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
  
  4. Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
  
  5. Check for existing [issues](https://github.com/nisrulz/ShoutOut/issues) first, before filing an issue.  
  
  6. Have fun!
